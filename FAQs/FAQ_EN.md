    <li><strong>iOS 15</strong>: YouTube v20.21.6</li>

  <summary>Cast stopped working on sideloaded YouTube Plus. What should I do?</summary>
    <p>Until this issue is resolved, it is recommended to use YouTube version 20.14.1 or below.</p>

  <summary>When I try to play a video, I get <strong><em>Something went wrong. Refresh and try again later.</em></strong></summary>
    <p>Before jumping to conclusions, let‚Äôs clarify a few things:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>This is NOT</strong> caused by ad blocking</li>
      <li><strong>This is NOT</strong> because your account was magically flagged</li>
      <li><strong>This is NOT</strong> due to your account being secretly blacklisted</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>The issue seems to lie somewhere in the sideloading process itself, even without any tweaks applied. It might be related to an invalid or missing VisitorID or VisitorData, as suggested <a href="https://github.com/pepeloni-away/userscripts/issues/6#issuecomment-2860641610">here</a>. This error has become more frequent due to YouTube‚Äôs stricter anti-download measures.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Possible temporary workaround:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Sign out of your current account (or all accounts) completely: Go to the <em>You tab ‚Üí Switch account ‚Üí Manage accounts on this device ‚Üí Remove from this device</em></li>
      <li>Watch a few full-length videos without being signed in. Stay signed out for a few hours.</li>
      <li>Sign back into the account that was having issues</li>
    </ol>
